    <h1>German Pork Chops and Sauerkraut</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>My dad learned to make pork chops and sauerkraut as a soldier during World War II from a local German woman during the Allied occupation of Germany. I don't know the German name for it, but this is a hearty and delicious pork dish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>8 center cut pork chops</li>
        <li>2 pounds sauerkraut, drained</li>
        <li>1 large red apple, diced</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon caraway seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Brown pork chops on both sides, about 5 minutes per side. Place chops into a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Mix sauerkraut, apple, onion, brown sugar, and caraway seeds in a bowl until well combined, and spread the sauerkraut mixture over the pork chops. Cover the dish with aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the pork is no longer pink inside, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chop should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
    </ol>
