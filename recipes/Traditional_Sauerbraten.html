    <h1>Traditional Sauerbraten</h1>
    <img src="./Traditional_Sauerbraten.webp" alt="Traditional Sauerbraten">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For this sauerbraten, I found two slightly different handwritten versions of my Grandmother's recipe. Born in Nekkar am Rhein in 1904, she naturally learned to cook traditional German meals as a young woman and didn't rely on a cookbook. I try to capture the nuance in this. Serve with potato dumplings.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3 pounds beef rump roast</li>
        <li>2 large onions, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup red wine vinegar, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>10 whole cloves, or more to taste</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves, or more to taste</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>10 gingersnap cookies, crumbled</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place beef rump roast, onions, vinegar, water, 1 tablespoon salt, 1 tablespoon black pepper, sugar, cloves, and bay leaves in a large pot. Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 3 days, turning meat daily. Remove meat from marinade and pat dry with paper towels, reserving marinade.</li>
        <li>Season flour to taste with salt and black pepper in a large bowl. Sprinkle flour mixture over beef. </li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium heat; cook beef until brown on all sides, about 10 minutes. Pour reserved marinade over beef, cover, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until beef is tender, 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Remove beef to a platter and slice. </li>
        <li>Strain solids from remaining liquid and continue cooking over medium heat. Add gingersnap cookies and simmer until gravy is thickened, about 10 minutes. Serve gravy over sliced beef.</li>
    </ol>
